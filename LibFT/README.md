# 📚 ABOUT Libft

The first project at 42, libft, involves learning how the standard functions of C programming work by writing them from scratch and creating a personal library. This project is vital as the library will be used in future assignments at 42.

## 🛠️ Testing Instructions

For testing, I used [SLDDL's Normino](https://github.com/SLDDL/Normino), a convenient, no-installation-required tester. Follow these steps to set up and run the tests:

### 1️⃣ **Ensure Your Project Compiles**

   Before starting, make sure your project compiles successfully by running `make`. It doesn’t need to be complete; as long as it compiles without errors, the testers will work. ✅

### 2️⃣ **Download Testers (via Normino)**

   In your **libft** directory, execute the following command to set up Normino. The tests will be downloaded to this directory.

   ```bash
   curl smasse.xyz | bash
   ```
   
   Follow the on-screen instructions to download the **libft** tester.

### 3️⃣ **Add Dynamic Library Compilation Rule to Your Makefile**

   Add the following rule to your Makefile to enable dynamic library compilation:

   ```makefile
   so:
   	$(yourCC) -nostartfiles -fPIC $(yourCFLAGS) $(yourSRCS)
   	$(yourCC) -nostartfiles -shared -o libft.so $(yourOBJS) $(yourBONUS_OBJS `only if doing bonus`)
   ```

   🔍 **Tip**: The values inside `$(...)` may vary depending on your Makefile configuration. Update these values according to your setup.

### 4️⃣ **Clean Up Before Running Tests**

   Run `make fclean` and delete any existing `libft.so` file before each test run to avoid conflicts. 🧹

### 5️⃣ **Run Testers**

   Now that you have the tests in your **libft** directory, navigate to the folder of the tester you want to use, and run `make` to start testing. Make sure to redo **Step 4** before each test run for best results.

### 6️⃣ **Cleanup After Testing**

   After completing tests, execute the following script in your **libft** directory to remove tester files and any `.o` files:

   ```bash
   bash removetests.sh
   ```

   🗑️ **Extra Cleanup**: Also delete the `a.out` file generated by the testers. Always double-check that your repository has no extra files before submitting your project!
