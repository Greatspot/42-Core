# üéÆ ABOUT so_long

The **so_long** project is a simple 2D game developed in C using the MiniLibX graphics library. The goal of the game is to guide a character through a maze, collecting items along the way and avoiding obstacles. The player must complete the game with the fewest number of moves possible.

## Prerequisites
Before compiling and running the project, make sure you have the MiniLibX installed in project folder. For that, after cloning, it's necessary to extract the contents of the `minilibx-Linux.tgz` file, rename the folder with the name `mlx`, and copy and paste this in the folder `lib`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Testing Instructions
To compile the project, run:
```bash
make or make bonus
```
This will compile the source files and generate the `so_long` or `so_long_bonus` executable.

## Execution
After compilation, you can run the game using the following command:

```bash
./so_long maps/valid/mandatory/small.ber  or  medium.ber  or  big.ber
./so_long_bonus maps/valid/bonus/small.ber  or  medium.ber  or  big.ber
```

#### MAKEFILE RULES

`make` - Compile so_long files.

`make bonus` - Compile so_long_bonus files.

`make all`  - Compile mandatory + bonus files.

`make clean`  - Delete all .o (object files) files.

`make fclean`  - Delete all .o (object files) and .a (executable) files.

`make re` - Use rules `fclean` + `all`.

## Game Rules
- The player starts at an initial position marked by a character.
- The goal is to collect a	ll the items represented by collectibles (`C`) on the map.
- The player must avoid obstacles represented by walls (`1`) and enemies (`E`).
- The player can move in the up, down, left, and right directions using the arrow keys.
- The game ends when the player collects all the items and returns to the initial position or is captured by an enemy.
- The number of moves made by the player is displayed in the game window.

## Controls
- `W`, `S`, `D`, `A` and `Arrow keys`: move the character in the up, down, left, and right directions.
- `ESC` key: exit the game.

## Sprites
The sprites used in the game were created by me using the GIMP application. Here a small tutorial on how to create sprites using GIMP: https://thegimptutorials.com/how-to-make-pixel-art/.
If you want to use the sprites that I created, or modify them, you can use the sprites.xcf file.

**2.** If your directory tree looks like this...

```txt
	‚îÇ
	‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ so_long_map_validator	(this directory)
	‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ so_long 				(your repository)
	‚îÇ
	...
```
then you can skip this step. Otherwise, you must change the **PROJ** variable on the **Makefile of so_long_invalidator**. It should look something like this:

```Makefile
	#_/=\_/=\_/=\_/=\_/=\_/=\_/=\_/=\_/=\_/=\_ FOLDERS _/=\_/=\_/=\_/=\_/=\_/=\_/=\_/=\_/=\_/=\_
	PROJ = ../so_long
```
